## [1.2.0] - 2025-11-21

### Added
- **Tool Profiles System** - Reduce token usage by loading only the tools you need
  - Three profiles: `minimal` (5 tools), `standard` (10 tools), `full` (16 tools)
  - Persistent configuration via `~/.config/notebooklm-mcp/settings.json`
  - Environment variable overrides: `NOTEBOOKLM_PROFILE`, `NOTEBOOKLM_DISABLED_TOOLS`

- **CLI Configuration Commands** - Easy profile management without editing files
  - `npx notebooklm-mcp config get` - Show current configuration
  - `npx notebooklm-mcp config set profile <name>` - Set profile (minimal/standard/full)
  - `npx notebooklm-mcp config set disabled-tools <list>` - Disable specific tools
  - `npx notebooklm-mcp config reset` - Reset to defaults

### Changed
- **Modularized Codebase** - Improved maintainability and code organization
  - Split monolithic `src/tools/index.ts` into `definitions.ts` and `handlers.ts`
  - Extracted resource handling into dedicated `ResourceHandlers` class
  - Cleaner separation of concerns throughout the codebase

### Fixed
- **LibreChat Compatibility** - Fixed "Server does not support completions" error
  - Added `prompts: {}` and `logging: {}` to server capabilities
  - Resolves GitHub Issue #3 for LibreChat integration

- **Thinking Message Detection** - Fixed incomplete answers showing placeholder text
  - Now waits for `div.thinking-message` element to disappear before reading answer
  - Removed unreliable text-based placeholder detection (`PLACEHOLDER_SNIPPETS`)
  - Answers like "Reviewing the content..." or "Looking for answers..." no longer returned prematurely
  - Works reliably across all languages and NotebookLM UI changes

## [1.1.2] - 2025-10-19

### Changed
- **README Documentation** - Added Claude Code Skill reference
  - New badge linking to [notebooklm-skill](https://github.com/PleasePrompto/notebooklm-skill) repository
  - Added prominent callout section explaining Claude Code Skill availability
  - Clarified differences between MCP server and Skill implementations
  - Added navigation link to Skill repository in top menu
  - Both implementations use the same browser automation technology

## [1.1.1] - 2025-10-18

### Fixed
- **Binary executable permissions** - Fixed "Permission denied" error when running via npx
  - Added `postbuild` script that automatically runs `chmod +x dist/index.js`
  - Ensures binary has executable permissions after compilation
  - Fixes installation issue where users couldn't run the MCP server

### Repository
- **Added package-lock.json** - Committed lockfile to repository for reproducible builds
  - Ensures consistent dependency versions across all environments
  - Improves contributor experience with identical development setup
  - Enables `npm ci` for faster, reliable installations in CI/CD
  - Follows npm best practices for library development (2025)

## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-18

### Added
- **Deep Cleanup Tool** - Comprehensive system cleanup for fresh NotebookLM MCP installations
  - Scans entire system for ALL NotebookLM files (installation data, caches, logs, temp files)
  - Finds hidden files in NPM cache, Claude CLI logs, editor logs, system trash, temp backups
  - Shows categorized preview before deletion with exact file list and sizes
  - Safe by design: Always requires explicit confirmation after preview
  - Cross-platform support: Linux, Windows, macOS
  - Enhanced legacy path detection for old config.json files
  - New dependency: globby@^14.0.0 for advanced file pattern matching
- CHANGELOG.md for version tracking
- Changelog badge and link in README.md

### Changed
- **Configuration System Simplified** - No config files needed anymore!
  - `config.json` completely removed - works out of the box with sensible defaults
  - Settings passed as tool parameters (`browser_options`) or environment variables
  - Claude can now control ALL browser settings via tool parameters
  - `saveUserConfig()` and `loadUserConfig()` functions removed
- **Unified Data Paths** - Consolidated from `notebooklm-mcp-nodejs` to `notebooklm-mcp`
  - Linux: `~/.local/share/notebooklm-mcp/` (was: `notebooklm-mcp-nodejs`)
  - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/notebooklm-mcp/`
  - Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\notebooklm-mcp\`
  - Old paths automatically detected by cleanup tool
- **Advanced Browser Options** - New `browser_options` parameter for browser-based tools
  - Control visibility, typing speed, stealth mode, timeouts, viewport size
  - Stealth settings: Random delays, human typing, mouse movements
  - Typing speed: Configurable WPM range (default: 160-240 WPM)
  - Delays: Configurable min/max delays (default: 100-400ms)
  - Viewport: Configurable size (default: 1024x768, changed from 1920x1080)
  - All settings optional with sensible defaults
- **Default Viewport Size** - Changed from 1920x1080 to 1024x768
  - More reasonable default for most use cases
  - Can be overridden via `browser_options.viewport` parameter
- Config directory (`~/.config/notebooklm-mcp/`) no longer created (not needed)
- Improved logging for sessionStorage (NotebookLM does not use sessionStorage)
- README.md updated to reflect config-less architecture

### Fixed
- **Critical: envPaths() default suffix bug** - `env-paths` library appends `-nodejs` suffix by default
  - All paths were incorrectly created with `-nodejs` suffix
  - Fix: Explicitly pass `{suffix: ""}` to disable default behavior
  - Affects: `config.ts` and `cleanup-manager.ts`
  - Result: Correct paths now used (`notebooklm-mcp` instead of `notebooklm-mcp-nodejs`)
- Enhanced cleanup tool to detect all legacy paths including manual installations
  - Added `getManualLegacyPaths()` method for comprehensive legacy file detection
  - Finds old config.json files across all platforms
  - Cross-platform legacy path detection (Linux XDG dirs, macOS Library, Windows AppData)
- **Library Preservation Option** - cleanup_data can now preserve library.json
  - New parameter: `preserve_library` (default: false)
  - When true: Deletes everything (browser data, caches, logs) EXCEPT library.json
  - Perfect for clean reinstalls without losing notebook configurations
- **Improved Auth Troubleshooting** - Better guidance for authentication issues
  - New `AuthenticationError` class with cleanup suggestions
  - Tool descriptions updated with troubleshooting workflows
  - `get_health` now returns `troubleshooting_tip` when not authenticated
  - Clear workflow: Close Chrome → cleanup_data(preserve_library=true) → setup_auth/re_auth
  - Critical warnings about closing Chrome instances before cleanup
- **Critical: Browser visibility (show_browser) not working** - Fixed headless mode switching
  - **Root cause**: `overrideHeadless` parameter was not passed from `handleAskQuestion` to `SessionManager`
  - **Impact**: `show_browser=true` and `browser_options.show=true` were ignored, browser stayed headless
  - **Solution**:
    - `handleAskQuestion` now calculates and passes `overrideHeadless` parameter correctly
    - `SharedContextManager.getOrCreateContext()` checks for headless mode changes before reusing context
    - `needsHeadlessModeChange()` now checks CONFIG.headless when no override parameter provided
  - **Session behavior**: When browser mode changes (headless ↔ visible):
    - Existing session is automatically closed and recreated with same session ID
    - Browser context is recreated with new visibility mode
    - Chat history is reset (message_count returns to 0)
    - This is necessary because NotebookLM chat state is not persistent across browser restarts
  - **Files changed**: `src/tools/index.ts`, `src/session/shared-context-manager.ts`

### Removed
- Empty postinstall scripts (cleaner codebase)
  - Deleted: `src/postinstall.ts`, `dist/postinstall.js`, type definitions
  - Removed: `postinstall` npm script from package.json
  - Follows DRY & KISS principles
